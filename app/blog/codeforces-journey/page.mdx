# Solving One Problem a Day: My Codeforces Journey

## Competitive Programming Meets Daily Discipline

![Codeforces](/codeforces.png)


Alongside my cybersecurity learning path, I’ve started a parallel challenge: solving [Codeforces problems consistently](https://codeforces.com/submissions/ciberportero), roughly one per day, while also taking [Harvard’s CS50 Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4). The goal isn’t speed or rating (at least not yet), but building strong problem‑solving fundamentals, clean Python habits, and algorithmic thinking that will pay off long term—especially in security, scripting, and automation.

In this blog post, I’ll share how this journey is going, how I structure my practice, and what I’m learning from each step.

## Practice Strategy

Rather than jumping randomly between problems, I decided on a simple and sustainable approach:

✅ Solve ~1 problem per day

✅ Work through problems in [order of how many times they were solved](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC) (starting with the most popular)

✅ Focus on understanding the logic, not just getting AC

✅ Solve everything in Python

✅ [Upload each solution to GitHub](https://github.com/gonzalogramagia/codeforces) for tracking and review

This structure removes decision fatigue and keeps progress steady, even on busy days.

## Learning in Parallel: CS50 Python

At the same time, I’m taking Harvard CS50’s Python course, which pairs extremely well with Codeforces practice. Concepts like:

![CS50 Python](/python-harvard-cs50.png)


*   loops and conditionals
*   lists and strings
*   input/output handling
*   clean code structure

show up constantly in competitive programming problems. Many Codeforces tasks feel like practical exercises reinforcing CS50 lessons, which makes both experiences stronger together.

## Completed Challenges So Far

### 1) Team — Codeforces 231A

**Topic:** Conditionals and Counting

This was a perfect warm‑up problem. Given multiple team members’ opinions (0 or 1), the task is to count how many problems the team will actually solve based on majority agreement.

**Key takeaways:**

*   parsing input correctly
*   summing boolean/int values
*   translating a word problem into simple logic

### 2) Watermelon — Codeforces 4A

**Topic:** Even numbers and edge cases

A classic beginner problem. The challenge looks trivial at first, but it teaches an important lesson: edge cases matter.

The watermelon must be split into two even, positive parts. That small constraint eliminates several naïve solutions.

**Lesson learned:** always re‑read the problem statement carefully.

### 3) Way Too Long Words — Codeforces 71A

**Topic:** Strings and indexing

This problem introduced basic string manipulation: abbreviating long words by keeping the first and last character and replacing the middle with a number.

**Skills practiced:**

*   string indexing
*   slicing
*   converting integers to strings

It’s a great example of how simple operations can solve a problem cleanly when you understand Python strings well.

## Code Organization & GitHub

All my solutions are uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/gonzalogramagia/codeforces), one file per problem, written as cleanly and readably as possible:

*   clear variable names
*   minimal but meaningful logic
*   no unnecessary complexity

This helps me:

*   track progress over time
*   revisit older problems
*   build a public portfolio of consistent practice

## Why This Matters (Especially for Cybersecurity)

Even though Codeforces is "competitive programming", the skills translate directly to cybersecurity:

*   logical thinking
*   breaking problems into steps
*   reading specifications carefully
*   writing reliable scripts

Combined with Python and security studies, this daily habit is helping me become more precise, faster at reasoning, and more confident with code.

## Going Forward

The plan is simple:

*   keep solving one problem per day
*   gradually increase difficulty
*   continue syncing Codeforces practice with CS50 Python concepts
*   maintain consistency over intensity

Small steps, every day.
