# Solving One Coding Challenge at a Time: My Codeforces Experience

## Competitive Programming Meets Daily Discipline

![Codeforces](/codeforces.png)


Alongside my cybersecurity learning path, I’ve started a parallel challenge: solving [Codeforces problems consistently](https://codeforces.com/submissions/ciberportero), roughly one per day, while also taking [Harvard’s CS50 Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4). The goal isn’t speed or rating (at least not yet), but building strong problem‑solving fundamentals, clean Python habits, and algorithmic thinking that will pay off long term—especially in security, scripting, and automation.

In this blog post, I’ll share how this journey is going, how I structure my practice, and what I’m learning from each step.

## Practice Strategy

Rather than jumping randomly between problems, I decided on a simple and sustainable approach:

✅ Solve ~1 problem per day

✅ Work through problems in [order of how many times they were solved](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC)

✅ Focus on understanding the logic, not just getting AC

✅ Solve everything in Python

This structure removes decision fatigue and keeps progress steady, even on busy days.

## Learning in Parallel: CS50 Python

At the same time, I’m taking Harvard CS50’s Python course, which pairs extremely well with Codeforces practice. Concepts like:

![CS50 Python](/python-harvard-cs50.png)


*   loops and conditionals
*   lists and strings
*   input/output handling
*   clean code structure

show up constantly in competitive programming problems. Many Codeforces tasks feel like practical exercises reinforcing CS50 lessons, which makes both experiences stronger together.

## Completed Challenges So Far

<ProblemSection id={1}>

### 1) Watermelon ([Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A))

**Topic:** Even numbers and edge cases

A classic beginner problem. The challenge looks trivial at first, but it teaches an important lesson: edge cases matter. The watermelon must be split into two even, positive parts.

<Spoiler>
```python
w = int(input())
 
if w > 2 and w % 2 == 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```
</Spoiler>

### 2) Way Too Long Words ([Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A))

**Topic:** Strings and indexing

This problem introduced basic string manipulation: abbreviating long words by keeping the first and last character and replacing the middle with a number.

<Spoiler>
```python
n = int(input())
 
for _ in range(n):
    w = input().strip()
 
    if len(w) > 10:
        first_letter = w[0]
        letters_between = len(w[1:-1])
        last_letter = w[-1]
        print(first_letter + str(letters_between) + last_letter)
    else:
        print(w)
```

### 3) Team ([Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A))

**Topic:** Conditionals and Counting

Given multiple team members’ opinions (0 or 1), the task is to count how many problems the team will actually solve based on majority agreement.

<Spoiler>
```python
n = int(input())
 
solutions = 0
 
for _ in range(n):
    votes = list(map(int,input().split()))
    # input() → "1 0 1" (a single string)
    # split() → ["1", "0", "1"] (list of strings)
    # map(int, ...) → 1, 0, 1 <iterator> producing integers
    # list(...) → [1, 0, 1] (list of integers)
    consensus = 0
    for v in votes:
        if v:
            consensus += 1
    if consensus > 1:
        solutions += 1
 
print(solutions)
```

### 4) Bit++ ([Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A))

**Topic:** Simulation and String Parsing

A simple simulation problem where we need to increment or decrement a variable based on the input statement (e.g., "X++", "--X").

<Spoiler>
```python
n = int(input())	# 1 <= n <= 150
 
result = 0
 
for _ in range(n):
	character = input()
	match character[0]:
		case "X":
			if character[1] == "+":
				result += 1
			else:
				result -= 1
		case "+":
			result += 1
		case "-":
			result -= 1
 
print(result)
```

### 5) Next Round ([Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/158/problem/A))

**Topic:** Arrays and Filtering

We need to determine how many participants advance to the next round based on a score threshold.

<Spoiler>
```python
nk = input().split()
n = int(nk[0])
k = int(nk[1])
 
# better alternative: n, k = map(int, input().split())
 
scores = list(map(int, input().split()))
kth_score = scores[k-1]
 
i = 0
 
for score in scores:
	if score < kth_score or score == 0:
		break
	i += 1
 
print(i)
```

### 6) Domino piling ([Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/50/A))

**Topic:** Math and Geometry

Calculating the maximum number of dominoes that can fit in a rectangular board.

<Spoiler>
```python
h, w = map(int, input().split())
 
squares = h * w
 
print(int(squares / 2))
```

## Why This Matters (Especially for Cybersecurity)

Even though Codeforces is "competitive programming", the skills translate directly to cybersecurity:

*   logical thinking
*   breaking problems into steps
*   reading specifications carefully
*   writing reliable scripts

Combined with Python and security studies, this daily habit is helping me become more precise, faster at reasoning, and more confident with code.

## Going Forward

The plan is simple:

*   keep solving one problem per day
*   gradually increase difficulty
*   continue syncing Codeforces practice with CS50 Python concepts
*   maintain consistency over intensity

Small steps, every day.
