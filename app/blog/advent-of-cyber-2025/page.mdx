Christmas has come early for cybersecurity enthusiasts! This year I've joined TryHackMe's **Advent of Cyber 2025**, an annual event offering daily security challenges for 24 days. It's a fantastic opportunity to learn new skills, brush up on fundamental concepts, and of course, do some hacking while enjoying the holidays!

Here I will be sharing my progress and what I learn in each challenge.

## 0) Advent of Cyber Prep Track

Before the main event started, I completed the "Prep Track". It was a series of warm-up tasks designed to get beginners ready (and refresh the memory of veterans) for what's coming. It covered essential basic concepts to ensure everyone is ready for the daily challenges.

## 1) Linux CLI - Shells Bells

**Topic:** Introduction to the Linux Command Line.

Day 1 started with the basics but fundamental: the Linux terminal. "Shells Bells" took us to explore the command-line interface (CLI), learning how to navigate the file system, manipulate files, and use essential commands. It was an excellent reminder of why Linux is the operating system par excellence in cybersecurity.

## 2) Phishing - Merry Clickmas

**Topic:** Social Engineering and Phishing.

Day 2 got interesting with "Merry Clickmas". We learned how to use the **Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)** to simulate phishing attacks. The challenge demonstrated how easy it can be to trick users into handing over their credentials and the importance of always being alert to suspicious emails.

## 3) Splunk Basics - Did you SIEM?

**Topic:** Log Monitoring and Analysis with Splunk.

On day 3, we delved into the world of defense (Blue Team) with "Did you SIEM?". We learned to ingest and parse custom logs using **Splunk**, one of the most popular SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools. It was great to see how suspicious activities can be detected by analyzing large volumes of data.

## 4) AI in Security - old sAInt nick

**Topic:** Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity.

Day 4, "old sAInt nick", showed us the power of AI. We explored how artificial intelligence can be used both to attack and defend systems. It is fascinating (and a bit scary) to see how these technologies are reshaping the security landscape.

## 5) Web Security - It’s Dangerously Obvious, Really

**Topic:** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).

Day 5 focused on a critical web vulnerability: **IDOR**. We explored how attackers can access unauthorized data simply by manipulating parameters like `user_id` or `packageID` in a URL. The challenge demonstrated that even if references are encoded (e.g., Base64) or hashed, they can often be bypassed if the server lacks proper authorization checks. It was a great lesson on the difference between authentication ("who you are") and authorization ("what you are allowed to do").

## 6) Malware Analysis - Principles of Malware Analysis

**Topic:** Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis.

Day 6 introduced the fascinating world of **Malware Analysis**. We learned to distinguish between **Static Analysis** (examining the file without running it) using tools like **PeStudio** to check strings and hashes, and **Dynamic Analysis** (executing the malware in a safe sandbox) using **Regshot** and **ProcMon** to observe its behavior, such as registry changes and system interactions. We practiced these techniques on a sample named `HopHelper.exe` to understand its malicious actions.

That's all for now! I will keep updating this post as I progress through the challenges. Stay tuned!
