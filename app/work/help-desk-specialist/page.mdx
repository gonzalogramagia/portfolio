# Help Desk Specialist

## <a href="https://www.stamm.bio/bio-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stämm Biotech (2023 - 2024)</a>

### Summary of Accomplishments
I managed the first line of IT support within a demanding R&D setting, ensuring the constant operability of critical lab equipment and corporate systems. I implemented a severity-based triage methodology that significantly improved the efficiency of the support team within a short period.

### Quantifiable Achievements & Impact
**Reduced Time-to-Resolution (TTR):** Decreased the average incident Time-to-Resolution (TTR) by 25% (from 8 hours to 6 hours) in just 5 months through the standardization of Level 1 diagnostic procedures.

**Improved Level 1 Resolution Rate:** Increased the rate of tickets solved at the first point of contact (Level 1) from 60% to 85%, freeing up the Senior IT team to focus on key infrastructure projects.

**Inventory Optimization:** Created and maintained a comprehensive Asset Management Database (CMDB) for 120+ IT and laboratory devices, resulting in a 15% reduction in downtime caused by missing or misallocated components.

### Key Responsibilities


**Technical Resolution:** Direct diagnosis and resolution of issues concerning hardware, software, network connectivity (VPNs, Wi-Fi), and specialized operating systems (Windows/Linux) relevant to the biotech sector.

**Documentation and Knowledge Base:** Developed and maintained technical documentation (Knowledge Base) for recurring errors, facilitating user self-service and the onboarding of new IT staff.

### Reason for Contract Completion

The role at Stämm Biotech was a strategic 5-month paid internship focused on optimizing support processes during a key period of company expansion. Having met and exceeded the established objectives (TTR reduction and improved L1 resolution rate), my decision not to pursue a permanent position was based on two strategic pillars:

**Geographical Consolidation:** I made a choice to establish a more sustainable, long-term working base in my city of residence.

**Career Transition:** I leveraged the successful completion of this project to initiate an active career pivot toward Software Development. This allowed me to immediately begin applying my operational expertise to complex engineering challenges as a freelancer, accelerating my specialization.
