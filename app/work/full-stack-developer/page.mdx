# Full Stack Developer

## <a href="https://catsulecorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catsule Corp (2024 – 2025)</a>

### <a href="https://catsulecorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus: Architecting Resilient Full-Stack Solutions and Operational Security.</a>

This role represents my identity as a freelancer and marked a pivotal shift in my career, moving from IT Operations—where I troubleshot existing corporate systems—to architecting and deploying custom web solutions from scratch. This transition gave me deep, hands-on exposure to end-to-end system resilience, security hardening, and operational integrity—skills that are now fueling my return to Cybersecurity and advanced IT Support.

### Early Projects & Mentorship
My journey into full-stack development began under the mentorship of a senior engineer with over a decade of industry experience. Before embarking on larger initiatives, I worked on two real-world applications that helped solidify my technical foundations:

*   **Clothing Store Frontend:** Developed the user interface for an e-commerce platform.
*   **Internal Stock & Finance System:** Built a full-stack solution for a used iPhone trading business to manage inventory and finances.

### Key Project: Digital Infrastructure for a High-Traffic Political Campaign

One of my most impactful projects was helping design and deploy the digital infrastructure for Alianza La Libertad Avanza de Córdoba, with a strong focus on performance, availability, and data security during critical campaign traffic spikes.

**Building for High Availability:** I engineered and deployed multiple campaign landing pages and informational sites designed to withstand extreme traffic.

**Security & QA:** I collaborated closely with the QA team to hunt down and patch critical defects and potential vulnerabilities. We hardened the application's surface area, achieving 99.5% software reliability before the public launch.

**Connecting the Dots:** I helped handle the full-stack integration, stitching together frontend services with backend APIs to ensure data integrity and smooth performance under peak load.

**How We Worked:** We operated within an Agile (Scrum/Kanban) framework. Planning sprints to ensure product integrity and adherence to secure coding standards at every step.

As this chapter came to a close, I chose to transition away from freelancing to focus on more structured, process-driven environments. This shift allows me to concentrate on my academic path in Cyberdefense, deepen my expertise in system reliability and security, **and continue growing in roles where collaboration, clear processes, and long-term impact are essential**.
